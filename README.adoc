= Reference Materials for DevOps and Automation courses

This is a collection of reference cards, cheat sheets, handbooks, and other materials
that can be helpful for students of Red Hat GPTE courses.

== Linux Commands

Even if you are a seasoned Linux user or admin, sometimes you need a refresher.

== Bash Commands

== Vim Editor

There are many Vim cheat sheets, from 1-pagers to long handbooks covering every detail. 
We've chosen the ones that contain the most important information in the very beginning:
how to exit Vim.

== Git

We don't use a full spectrum of Git commands in the courses.
But we have to know how to configure add and remove remote repositories.

== OpenShift

OpenShift `oc` command has a pretty good help system on its own, but sometimes it helps to have a cheat sheet handy.

== etcd

You may want to explore `etcd` - the distributed database which stores information about the cluster.
Also we use `etcd` as an example in the Operators Lab.
You can use commands from the following cheat sheet to test its functionality.

More detailed version is available on the CoreOS site: https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/dev-guide/interacting_v3.html


== Tmux

Tmux can help you with long-running scripts or playbooks.
It preserves your session in case your host connection is lost.

== Networking

== Docker

Docker is the container engine used in most of OpenShift deployments. 
It helps to know basic Docker commands.

== MongoDB

In some of our lab projects we use MongoDB.
We don't expect students to use MongoDB console commands, but it might be helpful to know some basics to debug if something does wrong with MongoDB cluster.

== Apache Maven

We use Maven to build our example applications.
If you want to learn more about various options of the `mvn` command, here is a reference for you.

Jenkins is the tool of choice in OpenShift for building pipelines.
We have added a one-pager cheatsheet and a much longer Handbook for Jenkins.
